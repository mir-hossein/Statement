# Statement

Regarding the CVE-2021-36593 and CVE-2021-36594, I would like to mention that I only had submitted a request to split the CVE-ID. (2 years ago)

The CVE-ID(s) will be published in the coming months as there is currently no available update. We have postponed the publishing process for the time being.
